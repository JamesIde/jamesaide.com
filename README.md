## Personal Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9fcda215-bdf5-47b2-a5a6-72c4a546aace/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/trusting-darwin-9db938/deploys)

My personal website. A place to display my hiking trips, photos, work experience and projects. View it [here](https://jamesaide.com/).

The front end was created with [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). All images and text are stored on Contentful and the site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The text provided by Contentful is rendered into normal html using [MDX](https://clubmate.fi/mdx-in-gatsby), which is like Markdown, but renders jsx and styling. This allows me to style dynamically generated HTML and bypass any TailwindCSS constraints.

## Resources I Used

- Harmen Hoek's [travel itinerary](https://harmenhoek.com/) for inspiration to create, design and document my adventures.
- Jamie Barnes' [website](https://www.jamiebarnesoutdoors.co.uk/) for further design inspiration.
- Max Mitchell's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6vxzu95sOI) on building his website with Gatsby and using Contentful. This was my first exposure to the world of content management systems in a well-layed out video with a tangible result at the end.

## Future Development

- Add pagination and search function for records and photos once they reach a certain size.
- Add a carousel for the main banner image.
- Write and publish records on non-hiking activities.
- Alter the styling to sooth my perfectionism.

## Closing Thoughts

For a long time I have wanted to create a site capable of supporting the material (primarily images) I've gathered on my travels. Eventually, this cultivated itself as the website you see today. The challenge of building a website like this presented itself as an ample opportunity to use technologies that were previously unknown to me, and allow me to creatively express myself in a manner I have never done before. Ultimately, the content on this website is for myself to look back at the adventures I've been on, and for those who are interested in seeing what I've been up to.
